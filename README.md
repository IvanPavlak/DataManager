# DataManager Project Overview

## Goal

As part of the onboarding process for a Junior Backend position, I was provided with two project pitches: 

1. Backend
2. Web API

These were designed to help me achieve several key objectives:

1. Acquiring proficiency in writing C# code.
2. Utilizing .NET and Entity Framework to build web applications.
3. Learning and applying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
4. Gaining foundational knowledge of web development.
5. Becoming adept at using Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio 2022, the dotnet CLI, NuGet, and other essential tools relevant to the position.

## Limitations

The project needed to be completed with the following:

- Programming Language: C#
- Framework: Entity Framework
- Database: PostgreSQL

No limitations were imposed on how the tasks should be solved, except for the requirement to use free software. It was clearly stated that the tasks were intended to serve as a guide rather than a strict requirement, allowing for multiple sensible approaches to their completion. There were also no restrictions on the tools, IDEs, code editors, NuGet packages, or any other tools needed to get the job done.

# Pitches

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project was refactored to use general names, models, and data. Generic terms such as "ModelOne" and "Gain Amount One" are used to avoid revealing any proprietary information. For this exact reason, data is generated using a [Python script](https://github.com/IvanPavlak/Data_Manager/blob/e334610f720c6bb6e9999b82ad9b9a48345bb313/DataManager.Core/Database/Data/generate_data.ipynb), and all the code has been refactored to operate with this generated data. Despite this refactoring, the data still closely mirrors the challenges I encountered and resolved to meet the project requirements
